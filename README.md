## About this fork

This is a fork of [linuxvoyage/linuxvoyage.github.io](https://github.com/linuxvoyage/linuxvoyage.github.io), reworked for students who **ssh into a shared server** rather than installing Linux on their own machine.

### What is different

**Corrections**, all also offered upstream:

* the grep lesson served the env lesson's content ([PR #1](https://github.com/linuxvoyage/linuxvoyage.github.io/pull/1))
* broken markup, a blank quiz answer, and five misleading statements ([PR #2](https://github.com/linuxvoyage/linuxvoyage.github.io/pull/2))

**Resequenced.** The course now opens with connecting to a server instead of ten pages on choosing a distribution. Text editing moved into the beginner section, tab completion moved to lesson two, `grep` moved to the front of Text-Fu, and the distribution tour, init systems and networking became background reading.

**New lessons**, none of which existed upstream:

| section | lessons |
| --- | --- |
| Connecting | ssh, ssh keys, VS Code over ssh |
| Command Line | filenames and quoting, nano |
| Scripting | shell variables, your first script, loops over files, exit codes and chaining |
| Jobs and Processes | interrupting commands, background jobs, screen sessions |
| Your Environment | PATH and export, installing your own tools |

**Removed.** Two vim lessons that were empty `# Title` placeholders upstream.

**Examples.** The core text-processing lessons (`sort`, `uniq`, `cut`) now work on a sample table rather than lists of animals, and the `sort -n` example no longer sorts words numerically.

### Rebuilding after an edit

Lessons are markdown under `lessons/locales/en_english/<section>/`, and each section has an order file listing its lessons. Both the per-lesson HTML and the static pages under `docs/` are generated, so edit the markdown and regenerate rather than editing HTML by hand.

### Based on

* [Linux Journey](https://github.com/cindyq/linuxjourney/) is a site dedicated to making learning Linux fun and easy.

* [LunaGNUisance/linuxjourney](https://github.com/LunaGNUisance/linuxjourney) for ordering the content.

* [web.archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20220706072307/https://linuxjourney.com/) for copying the original site's styles

* [itamarg365/linuxjourney](https://github.com/itamarg365/linuxjourney) for helping to serve locally.

### Usage - Serve the MD lessons with python3 app

#### From your machine:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd src
uvicorn main:app
```
#### From a typical container:
To serve from container, you might need to specify host address and port as
 1. running uvicorn will try to host at 127.0.0.1 which did not work while testing out of container
 2. you might have port 80 occupied for some other project.
```bash
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 9090
```
And...

#### Other minor issues:
If you find any lesson/page missing in a lesson, feel free to checkout the 
live version / 2023 version of Linux Journey 
[here](https://linuxvoyage.github.io/liveLJ/). Note: Quiz Q/A and 
translations will not work as expected.

### Brief History

Though Linux Journey was created to document the journey of the [original author](https://github.com/cindyq) and their contributors to learn Linux, everyone's journey is a little different. So, One fine day, the linuxjourney.com website went down and open source community was concerned. Hence, someone volunteered to help us serve it locally and then put it together as static site. After over 2 months, it seems the domain owner/author of the site, resurrected it up again.  So, Now We can further improve the knowledge of the greater Linux community through contribution and collaboration, again. Feel free to refer to below issues and may be make a contribution or PR. Good day!
